Reason for this fork is to easily get the `Fashionista` achievement in `The Outsider DLC`.

Directly unlocking all hats will not trigger the `Fashionista` achievement check, so we don't unlock the `Ce Petit Haute` hat which should instead be obtained correctly in-game with 2200 water in the second world's `Le Chapeau de Licorne`.
Obtaining the last hat that way will successfully trigger the achievement check!
